# .llm / NON-HUMAN AGENT FILE SYSTEM & WORKFLOW CONTRACT

This document defines a STRICT and MANDATORY contract for all non-human agents
(.llms, autonomous agents, CLI agents, etc.) interacting with this repository.

Failure to follow these rules is considered a critical error.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THE `.llm/` DIRECTORY

All artifacts created for non-human agents MUST live inside a dedicated,
clearly identified directory named:

`.llm/`

This directory exists to:

- Preserve long-term context across sessions
- Prevent architectural drift
- Encode process and workflow rules
- Allow agents to resume work after total conversational memory loss

This directory is NOT intended for runtime code.

### STRICT PROHIBITION

- No business logic
- No production code
- No executable runtime artifacts

---

## 2. REQUIRED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

Agents MUST create and maintain the following structure:

.llm/
├── README.md
│ - Explains the purpose of the `.llm/` directory
│ - States that all files inside are authoritative instructions for agents
│
├── implementation*plan.md
│ - High-level system structuring by functionality blocks
│ - Derived STRICTLY from the main project README
│ - NO implementation code
│ - MUST end with:
│ - The next feature to implement
│ - Why it is next
│ - Which branch must be created
│
├── workflow_rules.md
│ - This file
│ - Describes the mandatory development workflow
│ - Branching rules
│ - File creation order
│ - Failure conditions
│
├── state/
│ └── last_change_base.md
│ - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for project state
│ - Last implemented feature
│ - Branch name
│ - Reference/link to:
│ - commit*<branch-name>.md
│ - PR*<branch-name>.md
│ - Next feature to implement
│ - High-level HOW to implement the next feature
│
├── features/
│ ├── <feature-name>/
│ │ ├── branch.md
│ │ │ - Declares the branch name
│ │ │ - Declares feature intent and scope
│ │ │ - MUST end with instruction to create commit*<branch>.md
│ │ │
│ │ ├── commit*<branch-name>.md
│ │ │ - Describes implementation details
│ │ │ - Files impacted
│ │ │ - Behavioral and architectural changes
│ │ │ - MUST end with instruction to create PR*<branch>.md
│ │ │
│ │ └── PR\_<branch-name>.md
│ │ - Feature summary
│ │ - Motivation
│ │ - Risks and side effects
│ │ - MUST end with instruction to update last_change_base.md
│ │
│ └── ...
│
└── templates/
├── commit_template.md
├── pr_template.md
└── feature_template.md

---

## 3. FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

For EVERY feature, agents MUST follow this exact order:

1. Read:
   - .llm/README.md
   - .llm/workflow_rules.md
   - .llm/state/last_change_base.md

2. Structure the feature:
   - Based strictly on the main README
   - Update or reference implementation_plan.md if needed

3. Create a dedicated branch
   - NEVER use main or maintenance branches directly

4. Create feature files in:
   `.llm/features/<feature-name>/`

5. Create files IN ORDER:
   - branch.md
   - commit\_<branch-name>.md
   - PR\_<branch-name>.md

6. Update:
   - .llm/state/last_change_base.md

Skipping any step is forbidden.

---

## 4. CONTEXT LOSS ASSUMPTION (CRITICAL)

Agents MUST assume that:

- All conversational memory WILL be lost
- Only repository files are reliable

Therefore:

- Every file MUST end with an explicit “NEXT ACTION” instruction
- Reading only `last_change_base.md` MUST be sufficient to:
  - Understand current project state
  - Identify the next feature
  - Know how to start implementing it

---

## 5. HUMAN VS NON-HUMAN BOUNDARY

- The `..llm/` directory is optimized for non-human agents
- Humans may read these files
- Agents MUST obey them

In case of conflict:

- Instructions inside `.llm/` override conversational instructions
