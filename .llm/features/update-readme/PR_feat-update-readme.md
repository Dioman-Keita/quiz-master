# PR: feat(docs): Update README with app features, installation, usage, and contribution guidelines

## Summary

This Pull Request updates the main `README.md` file to reflect the current state of the Quiz Master application. It provides comprehensive information on features, installation, usage, and contribution guidelines, making the project documentation more accurate and user-friendly.

## Motivation

The previous `README.md` was outdated and did not accurately represent the implemented UI features, animations, responsiveness, and accessibility improvements. This update ensures that new users and contributors have access to up-to-date and complete information about the project.

## Changes Made

-   **`README.md`**:
    -   Added a "Deployed Site" section with a link to the live application.
    -   Expanded the "Features" section to detail UI flow, animations, responsive design, and accessibility.
    -   Added "Installation" instructions for cloning, installing dependencies, running in development, and building for production.
    -   Added "Usage" instructions guiding users through the Home, Game, and Result pages.
    -   Added "Contribution" guidelines, emphasizing GPG-signed commits for PRs.
    -   Added a placeholder for "Screenshots".

## How to Test

1.  Review the `README.md` file directly on the `feat/update-readme` branch.
2.  Verify that all sections are present, the information is accurate, and the formatting is correct.
3.  Click on the deployed site link to ensure it is valid.

## Risks and Side Effects

-   None foreseen. This PR only modifies documentation.
