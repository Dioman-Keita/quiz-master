# Branch: feat/ui-refinements

## Feature Intent and Scope

This branch focuses on refining the UI interactions and adding micro-animations to enhance the user experience of the Quiz Master application.

The scope of this feature includes:
1.  Adding subtle hover/active states for interactive elements (buttons, options).
2.  Implementing simple entry/exit animations for screens or major components.
3.  Ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across all UI elements.
4.  Exploring visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers beyond color change (e.g., a quick animation on the selected option).
