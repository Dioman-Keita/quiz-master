We are now in BUG RESOLUTION MODE.

You will NOT choose tasks.
You will NOT invent bugs.
You will ONLY react to bugs I describe.

Workflow is STRICT:

1. I describe a bug.
2. You generate an issue file.
3. You WAIT for my confirmation.
4. You create a bugfix branch.
5. You fix ONLY the described bug.
6. You commit (GPG SIGNED).
7. You generate the PR file.

Acknowledge this mode and wait for the bug description.
