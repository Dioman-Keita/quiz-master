## IDENTITY RULE

The agent is not allowed to change author, email,
or signing identity under any circumstances.

## ABSOLUTE RULES (NON NEGOTIABLE)

- The goal is to BUILD THE FULL UI.
- Backend robustness, error handling and optimizations come LATER.
- UI is always ITERATIVE.
- UI is NEVER frozen unless explicitly stated by the user.

FORBIDDEN TOPICS:

- robust-question-fetching
- backend robustness
- error handling strategies
- retries, edge cases, optimizations

If mentioned → STOP.

## GPG SIGNING RULE (CRITICAL)

All commits made on behalf of the user MUST be GPG signed.

Forbidden actions:

- Using --no-gpg-sign
- Disabling commit.gpgsign
- Modifying GPG-related git configuration

If a GPG-signed commit cannot be created:

- The agent MUST NOT commit
- The agent MUST ask the user for guidance

## 1. CURRENT PROJECT STATE

### 1.1 Implemented UI (ITERATIVE – NOT FINAL)

These elements EXIST but are NOT complete and MAY be modified freely.

- **UI Flow**: The complete UI flow from Home -> Game -> Result is implemented.
  - `HomePage`: Displays `ConfigForm` to start the quiz.
  - `GamePage`: Renders the `QuizBoard` which contains the main quiz logic, question display, and timer.
  - `ResultPage`: Shows the final score and a "Play Again" button.
  - `App.tsx`: Handles the routing between the pages.

- **Components**:
  - `ConfigForm`: Allows selecting category & difficulty (hardcoded).
  - `QuizBoard`: The main component for the quiz game.
  - `SummaryCard`: Displays the quiz results.

- **Styling**:
  - `QuestionCard`: Provides visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers, now with conditional pulse/shake animations.
  - `TimerDisplay`: Enhanced with larger font and pulsating animation for low time.
  - `Card`: Applied Glassmorphism effect.
  - Global styles (`index.css`): Added a dynamic gradient background to the body, and keyframe animations for fade-in, correct-answer-pulse, and incorrect-answer-shake.

- **Interactions**:
  - Subtle scale effect on hover added to interactive buttons (Question options, Start Quiz, Play Again, Retry Fetching Question).
  - Simple fade-in animation applied to main content areas of `HomePage`, `GamePage`, and `ResultPage`.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Layouts optimized for various screen sizes (`HomePage`, `ConfigForm`, `QuestionCard`, `SummaryCard`).
  - Responsive font sizes for main titles.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Interactive elements (buttons, selects) are keyboard navigable.
  - `aria-label` attributes added to `select` elements in `ConfigForm`.
  - `aria-live="polite"` added to `QuestionCard` title for screen reader announcements.
  - Color contrast and font sizes reviewed for readability.

- **Status**: UI Iteration (consideration for next phase)
- **Modifiable**: YES

## 2. PROTECTED COMPONENTS

ONLY logic-level features may be protected.

UI components are NEVER protected.

Currently protected:

- NONE

---

## 3. CURRENT GOAL (FOCUS)

BUILD THE COMPLETE USER INTERFACE.

This includes:

- Screens
- Layout
- Visual states
- User flow
- Buttons, forms, placeholders
- Loading / empty / mock states (VISUAL ONLY)

NO real error handling.
NO backend refactor.
NO robustness explanation.

---

## 4. NEXT FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT

### Description (WHAT)

Implement robust question fetching.

This involves:

- Fetching quiz categories dynamically from the Open Trivia Database API.
- Updating `ConfigForm` to use the dynamically fetched categories.
- Enhancing the `fetch-question.ts` API to use the selected category and difficulty from the `useQuizConfigStore` to fetch quiz questions.
- Implementing robust error handling and loading states for `fetch-question.ts`.
- Adding unit tests for new API utilities and updating existing tests.

---

### Branch Policy

A new branch MUST be created for this feature.

Branch name:
`feat/robust-question-fetching`

Only this branch is allowed.

---

### Allowed Files (SCOPE)

The agent MAY modify any related file, including but not limited to:

- src/entities/question/api/fetch-question.ts
- src/entities/question/api/fetch-question.test.ts
- src/entities/question/model/types.ts
- src/features/quiz-config/ui/config-form.tsx
- src/entities/question/api/fetch-categories.ts (new file)
- src/entities/question/api/fetch-categories.test.ts (new file)

---

## 5. EXECUTION ORDER

1. Create and switch to branch `feat/robust-question-fetching`
2. Implement dynamic category fetching and update `ConfigForm`.
3. Enhance `fetch-question.ts` for robust question fetching with error handling and loading states.
4. Add unit tests.
5. Update this file ONLY to describe progress.

---

## 6. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

- Do NOT reimplement completed features.
- Do NOT modify protected components (except as explicitly allowed in allowed files).
- Do NOT change the execution order.
- Do NOT invent new tasks.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT commit outside the specified branch.

---

## 7. PRE-EXECUTION CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before writing code, the agent MUST confirm:

1. The goal is backend robustness and dynamic data fetching.
2. The branch is `feat/robust-question-fetching`.
3. The work is focused on the described scope.

If not → STOP.
